# mountinfo2

A Rust crate for parsing the mount points in Linux and other Unix systems. Can be used to query the filesystems mounted on the system. Forked from [mountinfo](https://github.com/GuillemCastro/mountinfo).

This crate automatically parses some of the mount options, and cointains functions for querying if, for example, a path is mounted on a particular filesystem.
